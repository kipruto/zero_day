Learning How to Work Locally on Git

This project is designed to help you learn how to work with Git locally, step by step. You will start by setting up Git on your computer and creating a local repository. Then, you will learn how to add files, make changes, and commit them to the local repository.

Throughout the project, you will learn about the different Git commands and concepts, such as:

Initializing a Git repository
Adding files to the staging area
Making changes and committing them
Viewing the commit history
Creating branches and merging them
Resolving conflicts
Ignoring files with .gitignore
Reverting changes
By the end of the project, you will have a solid understanding of how Git works locally and how to use it to manage your files and collaborate with others. You will also have a practical hands-on experience of working with Git, which will prepare you for more advanced Git workflows and techniques.

So, let's get started with learning how to work locally on Git!
